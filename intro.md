Hello World ðŸ––

I'm Constant, a passionate Data Engineer with a strong foundation in Data Analytics, Cloud, and DevOps.

After earning a Master's in International Business in 2017, I pivoted to the data and IT fields, driven by my curiosity and growing love for all things data.

My journey as a self-taught Data Analyst led me to pursue further upskilling and validation through postgraduate diplomas in both Software Engineering and Cloud/DevOps Engineering.

I'm now on the lookout for exciting opportunities as an Analytics Engineer with a Cloud and DataOps twist.

Let's connect and explore!
